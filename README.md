This repository consists of my leetcode solutions. 
I have added multiple solutions for the same problem:
    the first one is the approach I used initially which maybe a brute force approach or a semi-efficient algorithm.
    the second one (-optimised) is the approach i used after looking up the solutions and understanding the time/space efficient algorithms
